 abstract = {We present a novel technique which integrates automatic, part centered design of customized fingertips with a grasp planning stage for arbitrary parts of an assembly process. Starting with a set of CAD models of parts in an assembly sequence, force closure grasps are generated for each part in a sampling process. By employing the sampled force closure grasp positions in the second stage, the fingertip shape model is adapted to obtain form closure grasps at the specific grasp locations on the part. This approach significantly reduces the process time of designing fingers. Furthermore, the method increases the robustness of the fingers grasp for precise assemblies. The proposed fast generic automated finger design (FGAFD) method is able to design fingers for various geometrically complex workpieces. The designed fingers are experimentally verified. The results are discussed in detail and benchmarked against existing approaches.},

@article{Liu.2022,
 abstract = {In the soft gripper design work, most of the designs such as gripping width and the design of finger actuator are purely based on experience, and repeated trial-and-error. In most scenarios, the designed actuators cannot achieve the best/optimized grasping performance with a specific design type. This optimized design is important especially for the food grasping application, as a minor improvement of the grasping capability will be helpful to increase the grasping success ratio, especially during high-speed pick and place tasks. That motivates us to develop a design optimization framework, focusing on how to achieve an optimized grasping performance with a multi-objective design optimization. In this work, a simulation aided data-driven optimization framework for guiding the design of a reconfigurable soft gripper system is presented. To achieve an effective optimization, a simulation model is developed based on the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) platform. This model can predict the bending and grasping behavior under actuation and external loading. This model is then used in a data-driven design optimization framework for optimizing the actuator design. An artificial neural network (ANN) is built based on the simulation results as training data, and used as a surrogate model in a multi-objective optimization framework, to achieve an optimal grasping capability with design constraints. This simulation and optimization capability can significantly reduce the trial-and-error design work, and has a great potential for effectively developing soft robots in industrial applications, such as food manufacturing and health care.},

@article{Liu.2020b,
 abstract = {This article presents an innovative, motor-driven, three-finger compliant gripper for adaptive grasping of size-varied delicate objects. An optimized compliant finger design is identified numerically through a topology optimization method. A stepper motor is used to actuate three identical compliant fingers, which can operate through elastic bending deformation. Finite-element models are developed to investigate the maximum equivalent stress, input force, and output displacement relations corresponding to the amount of input displacement of the compliant finger. Simulation results show that the proposed finger design is with a lower driving force and a lower maximum equivalent stress during operation comparing to one previous design. The proposed compliant finger is prototyped by three-dimensional printing using thermoplastic elastomer. Experimental results for the input displacement versus input force and input displacement versus geometric advantage relationships of the prototyped finger agree well with simulation results. The developed three-finger soft robotic gripper is mounted on an industrial robot arm to demonstrate its capability in handing size-varied delicate objects, such as egg, fruits, and glass products. Experimental results show that the proposed three-finger gripper can be used to grip object with a maximum weight of 4.2 kg and a maximum object size of 140 mm. The overall weight of the developed three-finger soft robotic gripper is 1.2 kg. The load capacity of the developed gripper can vary according to the friction between gripper and object. The maximum payload of the gripper can be increased to 9.5 kg when an additional antislip foam tape is applied on the grip surfaces of the compliant fingers.},

@article{Liu.2018b,
 abstract = {This study presents the design of an underactuated, two-finger, motor-driven compliant gripper for grasping size-varied unknown objects. The gripper module consists of one main frame structure and two identical compliant fingers. The compliant finger is a monolithic compliant mechanism synthesized using a topology optimization method, and then prototyped by 3D printing using flexible filament. The input port for each finger is mounted on a moving platform driven by a gear motor, whereas the fixed port of the finger is mounted on a fixed platform. Each compliant finger can be actuated through the linear motion of the moving platform, and can deform elastically to generate the grasping motion. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, the gripper module is mounted on a six-axis robotic arm to pick and place a variety of objects. The results show that objects with the sizes between 42 and 141 mm can be grasped by the developed soft robotic gripper. The maximum payload for the gripper is 2.1 kg. The proposed compliant gripper is a low-cost design that can be used in grasping of size-varied vulnerable objects.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end grasp evaluation model to address the challenging problem of localizing robot grasp configurations directly from the point cloud. Compared to recent grasp evaluation metrics that are based on handcrafted depth features and a convolutional neural network (CNN), our proposed PointNetGPD is lightweight and can directly process the 3D point cloud that locates within the gripper for grasp evaluation. Taking the raw point cloud as input, our proposed grasp evaluation network can capture the complex geometric structure of the contact area between the gripper and the object even if the point cloud is very sparse. To further improve our proposed model, we generate a larger-scale grasp dataset with 350k real point cloud and grasps with the YCB object set for training. The performance of the proposed model is quantitatively measured both in simulation and on robotic hardware. Experiments on object grasping and clutter removal show that our proposed model generalizes well to novel objects and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This work presents an origami-based shape morphing fingertip design to actively tackle the grasping stability and dexterity problems. The proposed fingertip utilizes origami as its skeleton providing degrees of freedom at desired positions and motor-driven four-bar-linkages as its transmission components to achieve a compact size of the fingertip. 3 morphing types that are commonly observed and essential in robotic grasping are studied and validated with geometrical modeling. Experiments including grasping an object with convex point contact to pivot or do pinch grasping, grasped object reorientation, and enveloping grasping with concave fingertip surfaces are implemented to demonstrate the advantages of our fingertip compared to conventional parallel grippers. Multi-functionality on enhancing grasping stability and dexterity via active adaptation given different grasped objects and manipulation tasks are justified.

 abstract = {The design of man-made objects is dominated by computer aided design (CAD) tools. Assisting design with data-driven machine learning methods is hampered by lack of labeled data in CAD's native format; the parametric boundary representation (B-Rep). Several data sets of mechanical parts in B-Rep format have recently been released for machine learning research. However, large scale databases are largely unlabeled, and labeled datasets are small. Additionally, task specific label sets are rare, and costly to annotate. This work proposes to leverage unlabeled CAD geometry on supervised learning tasks. We learn a novel, hybrid implicit/explicit surface representation for B-Rep geometry, and show that this pre-training significantly improves few-shot learning performance and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on several existing B-Rep benchmarks.},

There exists a large body of work in developing representations for 3D shapes. However, there has been limited work done in developing domain-dependent benchmark databases for 3D shape searching. We propose a benchmark database for evaluating shape-based search methods relevant to the mechanical engineering domain. Twelve different shape descriptors belonging to three categories, namely: (1) feature vector-based, (2) histogram-based, and (3) view-based, are compared using the benchmark database. The main contributions of this paper are the development of a new engineering shape benchmark and an understanding of the effectiveness of different shape representations for classes of engineering parts. Overall, it was found that view-based representations yielded better retrieval results for a majority of shape classes, while no single method performed best for all shape categories.},

 abstract = {The problem of grasping is essential in robotics, in which robotic hands grasp target objects by deploying contact force. The contact between robotic hand and target object is always reduced to point-to-point while generally the actual type should be surface-to-surface. In this paper, we propose a novel surface contact model to parameterize the contact area. It computes the grasp quality of the contacts between the robotic hand and target object, then determines whether or not the surface-contact-based end effectors can resist an external wrench on target object. The key idea of the proposed approach is that the contact modeling is based on surface-to-surface contact rather than equivalent contact points which is more in line with the actual situations. Then we propose a grasp quality evaluation network based on surface-to-surface contact to evaluate grasp motion, which can capture the geometric feature of the actual contact area and classify the quality level of input grasp. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods (e.g. GPD and PointNetGPD) demonstrate that our approach could achieve superior performance.},

 abstract = {Modular robots are made up of a set of components which can be configured and reconfigured to form customized robots for a wide range of tasks. Fully utilizing the flexibility of modular robots is challenging, as it requires the identification of optimal modular designs for each given task, often with limited computation and time. Previous works in design automation achieve efficient run-times by utilizing machine learning to create a one-to-one mapping from task to design. However, the problem of robot design is often multimodal, where multiple distinct designs can be similarly or equally good for a task. Alternative design solutions may be needed in the field, for instance, if a module in the optimal design fails and no replacement is available. This paper presents a novel method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) that learns a one-to-many mapping from task to a distribution of designs. We apply our method to construct locomoting modular robots for terrains with varying obstacle heights and infill. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art, and find that our algorithm results in better solution quality, diversity, and alternatives for when the optimal design fails.},

 abstract = {An effective representation of additive manufacturing (AM) data is important for ensuring the repeatability of AM processes and the reproducibility of AM parts. Recently, several standardised representations have been developed and used in the industry. While at the same time, a number of other representations have been presented within the academia. The coexistence of different representations generates a series of questions and discussions: What is a representation of AM data? Are the standardised representations comprehensive enough to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility? What challenges have been addressed so far in the presented representations? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each representation? What are the main issues in the field of AM data representation currently? What are the potential research directions of AM data representation in the future? To approach these questions, a review of the existing representations of AM data is presented in this paper. Firstly, an in-depth analysis of the existing representations is provided. Then, detailed comparisons among these representations are made, and a discussion about the main issues in AM data representation is carried out on the basis of the comparisons. Finally, some future research directions of AM data representation are suggested.},

 abstract = {We present a system for accurate real-time mapping of complex and arbitrary indoor scenes in variable lighting conditions, using only a moving low-cost depth camera and commodity graphics hardware. We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

@article{Wolniakowski.2017,
 abstract = {In this work, we present a generic approach to optimize the design of a parametrized robot gripper including both selected gripper mechanism parameters, and parameters of the finger geometry. We suggest six gripper quality indices that indicate different aspects of the performance of a gripper given a CAD model of an object and a task description. These quality indices are then used to learn task-specific finger designs based on dynamic simulation. We demonstrate our gripper optimization on a parallel finger type gripper described by twelve parameters. We furthermore present a parametrization of the grasping task and context, which is essential as an input to the computation of gripper performance. We exemplify important aspects of the indices by looking at their performance on subsets of the parameter space by discussing the decoupling of parameters and show optimization results for two use cases for different task contexts. We provide a qualitative evaluation of the obtained results based on existing design guidelines and our engineering experience. In addition, we show that with our method we achieve superior alignment properties compared to a naive approach with a cutout based on the ``inverse of an object''. Furthermore, we provide an experimental evaluation of our proposed method by verifying the simulated grasp outcomes through a real-world experiment.},

@article{Honarpardaz.2019,
 abstract = {Finger design automation is highly demanded from robot industries to fulfill the requirements of the agile market. Nevertheless, literature lacks a promising approach to automate the design process of reliable fingers for industrial robots. Hence, this work proposes the generic optimized finger design (GOFD) method which automates the design process of single- and multi-function finger grippers. The proposed method includes an optimization algorithm to minimize the design process time. The method is utilized to generate fingers for several groups of objects. Results show that the GOFD method outperforms existing methods and is able to reduce the design time by an average of 16,600~s. While the proposed method substantially reduces the design process time of fingers, the quality of grasps is comparable to the traditional exhaustive search method. The grasp quality of GOFD deviates only 0.47{\%} from the absolute best grasp known from the exhaustive search method in average. The designed fingers are lastly manufactured and experimentally verified.},

@article{Seff.,
 abstract = {Parametric computer-aided design (CAD) tools are the predominant way that engineers specify physical structures, from bicycle pedals to airplanes to printed circuit boards. The key characteristic of parametric CAD is that design intent is encoded not only via geometric primitives, but also by parameterized constraints between the elements. This relational specification can be viewed as the construction of a constraint program, allowing edits to coherently propagate to other parts of the design. Machine learning offers the intriguing possibility of accelerating the design process via generative modeling of these structures, enabling new tools such as autocompletion, constraint inference, and conditional synthesis. In this work, we present such an approach to generative modeling of parametric CAD sketches, which constitute the basic computational building blocks of modern mechanical design. Our model, trained on real-world designs from the SketchGraphs dataset, autoregressively synthesizes sketches as sequences of primitives, with initial coordinates, and constraints that reference back to the sampled primitives. As samples from the model match the constraint graph representation used in standard CAD software, they may be directly imported, solved, and edited according to downstream design tasks. In addition, we condition the model on various contexts, including partial sketches (primers) and images of hand-drawn sketches. Evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its ability to synthesize realistic CAD sketches and its potential to aid the mechanical design workflow.},

@article{Ringwald.2023,
 abstract = {The adaption of robotic assembly lines to new products is generally slow and costly, binding the economical usage of a single line to a few products manufactured in masses. An important time factor is the adaption of the assembly robot's gripper fingers to the new product components - since finger design, production, and mounting is done manually. In this letter, we introduce an approach for automatic task-specific fingertip production and application. Our system is potentially able to reduce the assembly line customization time mentioned above by automatically printing customized fingertips onto a pre-produced finger-base and storing them in a dedicated finger library before the product assembly process begins. The assembly robot can then autonomously load and use these produced and stored fingers for the designated manipulation task by utilizing a specially developed quick finger exchange system. The setup is experimentally validated by conducting automatic production of three different fingertips and executing grasp-stability tests as well as multiple pick- and insertion tasks, with and without position offsets - using these fingertips. The proposed approach, indeed, goes beyond fingertip production and serves as a foundation for a fully automatic fingertip design, production, and application pipeline.},

 abstract = {Gripper design process is one of the interesting challenges in the context of grasping within industry. Typically, simple parallel-finger grippers, which are easy to install and maintain, are used in platforms for robotic grasping. The context switches in these platforms require frequent exchange of gripper fingers to accommodate grasping of new products, while subjected to numerous constraints, such as workcell uncertainties due to the vision systems used. The design of these fingers consumes the man-hours of experienced engineers, and involves a lot of trial-and-error testing. In our previous work, we have presented a method to automatically compute the optimal finger shapes for defined task contexts in simulation. In this paper, we show the performance of our method in an industrial grasping scenario. We first analyze the uncertainties of the used vision system, which are the major source of grasping error. Then, we perform the experiments, both in simulation and in a real setting. The experiments confirmed the validity of our approach. The computed finger design was employed in a real industrial assembly scenario.},

 abstract = {The state of the art in computer vision has rapidly advanced over the past decade largely aided by shared image datasets. However, most of these datasets tend to consist of assorted collections of images from the web that do not include 3D information or pose information. Furthermore, they target the problem of object category recognition - whereas solving the problem of object instance recognition might be sufficient for many robotic tasks. To address these issues, we present a high-quality, large-scale dataset of 3D object instances, with accurate calibration information for every image. We anticipate that ``solving'' this dataset will effectively remove many perception-related problems for mobile, sensing-based robots. The contributions of this work consist of: (1) BigBIRD, a dataset of 100 objects (and growing), composed of, for each object, 600 3D point clouds and 600 high-resolution (12 MP) images spanning all views, (2) a method for jointly calibrating a multi-camera system, (3) details of our data collection system, which collects all required data for a single object in under 6 minutes with minimal human effort, and (4) multiple software components (made available in open source), used to automate multi-sensor calibration and the data collection process.

In this paper, we present the design and testing of a passive mechanical tool changer designed for a project involving the inspection of an acidic and radioactive air duct. The tool changer relied on the active/passive motions of a compliant manipulator to perform tool changes and contains no electrical or pneumatic components. The resulting tool changing operation utilizes a developed compliant controller that relies exclusively on contact forces to guide the manipulator, and thus eliminates the need for precision operation or any assistance from the operator. The design features a locking system to ensure secure storage of tools that are not in use. Furthermore, the connection mechanism includes a bore scope camera for use when tools are not attached or to visually verify tool connections. Testing and demonstrations were performed to validate both the design and operation as well as show both the tools and tool changer perform in an extreme environment. The design requirements, iterative process, and prototype testing with the manipulator are also discussed.},

 abstract = {Gripper fingers design is a current and important problem in industrial robotics. Recently, advances have been made to replace the arduous manual trial-and-error design process with optimization methods based on dynamic simulations. In these approaches, the gripper fingers are parametrized and evaluated by simulating multiple grasp sets in order to obtain the quality score, which is subsequently optimized. The computational efficiency of this process depends on: (1) the choice of the scoring function that provides robust evaluation with minimal number of grasps, (2) the choice of optimization algorithm that converges to global optimum quickly and (3) the choice of optimization method and meta-parameters. In this paper, we present considerations pertaining to these three problems. We use the previously proposed gripper finger design and optimization methods for generating a finger cut-out for an asymmetrical object used in industrial assembly tasks. We suggest two new alignment quality scores and compare their efficiency with preexisting methods. In addition, compare the performance of two optimization methods (one local and one global) and find the meta-parameters for the local method.},

Likewise, the ability to morph and acquire new skills can facilitate an embodied agent to solve tasks of varying complexities. In this work, we introduce a data-driven approach where effective hand designs naturally emerge for the purpose of grasping diverse objects. Jointly optimizing morphology and control imposes computational challenges since it requires constant evaluation of a black-box function that measures the performance of a combination of embodiment and behavior. We develop a novel Bayesian Optimization algorithm that efficiently co-designs the morphology and grasping skills through learned latent-space representations. We design the grasping tasks based on a taxonomy of human grasp types: power grasp, pinch grasp, and lateral grasp. Through experimentation and comparative study, we demonstrate that our approach discovers robust and cost-efficient hand morphologies for grasping novel objects.

One of the challenges is to choose an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e., the 6D pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that is based on the assumption that similarly shaped objects can be grasped in a similar way. It is able to synthesize good grasp poses for unknown objects by finding the best matching object shape templates associated with previously demonstrated grasps. The grasp selection algorithm is able to improve over time by using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates to new situations. We tested our approach on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM robot, which have very different hand kinematics. Furthermore, we compared our algorithm with other grasp planners and demonstrated its superior performance. The results presented in this paper show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of unknown objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does improve its performance over time.},

A rich repertoire of soft robots designed from intuitive or biomimetic approaches have been developed to provide new solutions for robots. However, these design approaches are limited by the designers' experience and inspiration, and a systematic design methodology for soft robots is still missing. We tackle this issue by mathematically recasting the design problem under the framework of topology optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, in this paper, we develop a pneumatically actuated soft gripper consisting of three fingers, each finger is able to undergo a free travel bending and deliver a grasping force. Hence, each gripper finger is designed as a continuum compliant mechanism to achieve its maximal bending deformation. The proposed soft gripper with complex shape is directly fabricated through 3D printing technology. Experimental results show that the deflected soft finger is able to achieve a 41° free travel bending and generate 0.68N blocked force upon 0.11MPa actuation pressure. This work represents an important step towards the goal of designing soft robots automatically.},

@phdthesis{Dhakal.,
 abstract = {The purpose of this thesis was to design automatic tool changer for Universal collaborative robot UR5. The thesis topic was commissioned by HAMKTech Robotics, a research department of HAMK university of applied sciences. The main target of this thesis was to make a complete automatic system for changing the tool of a robot when two or more tools are required for completing the operation.



Automatic tool changer makes work a lot easier and faster. Initially, the tool used to be changed manually but the consequence was not good as it used to consume more productive time into an unproductive thing and sometimes it is not precise. So, the commissioning party wanted to make a tool changer for UR5 robot which will work automatically. The payload of the robot and the supply of pneumatic and electrical components are the main aspects that need to be considered while designing the tool changer.



This thesis was started with a lot of web-based research and was made with close collaboration with the supervisor as well as with the client. The old existing solutions were used as a guideline in order to make a clear new solution which consists of all the requirement as needed.



The thesis consists of design ideas of automatic tool changer, CAD model and pictures of 3D printed parts. The ideas and other calculations can be used to produce the design if needed.},

ShapeNet contains 3D models from a multitude of semantic categories and organizes them under the WordNet taxonomy. It is a collection of datasets providing many semantic annotations for each 3D model such as consistent rigid alignments, parts and bilateral symmetry planes, physical sizes, keywords, as well as other planned annotations. Annotations are made available through a public web-based interface to enable data visualization of object attributes, promote data-driven geometric analysis, and provide a large-scale quantitative benchmark for research in computer graphics and vision. At the time of this technical report, ShapeNet has indexed more than 3,000,000 models, 220,000 models out of which are classified into 3,135 categories (WordNet synsets). In this report we describe the ShapeNet effort as a whole, provide details for all currently available datasets, and summarize future plans.},

 abstract = {Successful material selection is critical in designing and manufacturing products for design automation. Designers leverage their knowledge and experience to create high-quality designs by selecting the most appropriate materials through performance, manufacturability, and sustainability evaluation. Intelligent tools can help designers with varying expertise by providing recommendations learned from prior designs. To enable this, we introduce a graph representation learning framework that supports the material prediction of bodies in assemblies. We formulate the material selection task as a node-level prediction task over the assembly graph representation of CAD models and tackle it using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Evaluations over three experimental protocols performed on the Fusion 360 Gallery dataset indicate the feasibility of our approach, achieving a 0.75 top-3 micro-f1 score. The proposed framework can scale to large datasets and incorporate designers' knowledge into the learning process. These capabilities allow the framework to serve as a recommendation system for design automation and a baseline for future work, narrowing the gap between human designers and intelligent design agents.},
